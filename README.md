Happy birthday, Max! ðŸŽ‚

Welcome! April 25 is [Max Wofford](https://maxwofford.com/)'s birthday, and the goal of this site (and this repository) is to display his birthday wishes.

### Leave a birthday wish by creating a file [in cards](https://github.com/hackclub/maxday/tree/master/cards)

Name the file after your first name, and place the following lines at the start of it:

    ---
    author: 'your first name, same as filename'
    ---    

Check out [Mingjie's card](https://github.com/hackclub/maxday/blob/master/cards/mingjie.md) as an example of how to write one, or view the [instructions page](https://maxday.hackclub.com/instructions).
