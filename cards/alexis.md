Howdy, max! 🤠 I wanted to wish you a very happy birthday!!🎂🎉 You've been such a great help and friend introducing me to programming along with Zach. I can't believe that it's already been close to 3 years since I first attended Hack Club and you taught me all those neat Javascript tips and tricks. All the hack nights and hackathons in SF were a blast. Now I'm in my first year at UCSB, learning about crazy stuff like automata and abstract data structures like red/black trees. It's a lot to handle but thanks to you I'm sure that I'll be able to hack my way through. I'll never forget how you motivated me to be creative and use programming to express myself. Now I can make pretty much anything I want, no matter how wacky or dumb. I hope you continue to inspire those around you and give them the same energy, and I hope you take some time to celebrate your birthday. You're awesome.
