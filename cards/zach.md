you are in a boat  
&nbsp;&nbsp;on land  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going through the street  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to teach kids how to code  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is one problem  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...you don't know how to code

Happy birthday. To many dreams yet to come.
